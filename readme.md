# Fitness Tracking Project

# Author: Amasil Rahim Zihad & Fabiha Fairuzz Subha

## Version: 2.2

### This is fitness tracking program that allows the user to input their information and get back various results from that

### Running  the jar file

- We will need [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) installed.
  (Recommended version is at least java 18)

### To check the version:

- Type "java -version" in terminal or cmd which will show the version.  
  We will also need [javafx-sdk](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).

- After downloading javafx-sdk and extract it and note the path where it was extracted.

- To run the program navigate to its folder and then open a terminal or cmd windows there and write the following:

- > java --module-path "javafx-sdk path here\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar CPSC233W22Project.jar

- So if javafx-sdk is in "C:\Program Files\Java\" the cmd command code would be:

- > java --module-path "C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-18\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar CPSC233W22Project.jar
  
- Or on macOS if javafx-sdk is in "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/" the terminal command would be:

- > java --module-path "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/javafx-sdk-18/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar CPSC233W22Project.jar

- There is also an option to save the calorie burnt information of the user to a file
- At the very bottom there is a status bar which shows if any changes were made or any error occurred. The program can
  also save the information of the people that the user changed/created in a .txt file that can be later loaded to get
  the same information. This can be done with the *Save* as option in *File* in the menu bar.

To exit the program, the user can simply press the close button on the window or use the *Quit* option in the *File*
option in menu
